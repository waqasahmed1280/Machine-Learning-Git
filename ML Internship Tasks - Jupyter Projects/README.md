Machine Learning Project - Multiple Tasks

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This repository contains four different machine learning tasks implemented using Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb). Each task involves different aspects of machine learning, such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

All files are placed in the main directory for easy access:

task_1.ipynb - [Task 1] Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

task_2.ipynb - [Task 2] Model Implementation and Training.

task_3.ipynb - [Task 3] Model Evaluation and Comparison.

task_4.ipynb - [Task 4] Data Visualization and Insights.

dataset.csv - The dataset used in different tasks.

requirements.txt - List of required Python libraries.

visuals/ - Screenshots of data visualizations and model performance.

README.md - Project documentation (this file).

ðŸš€ How to Run Each Task

ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Data Preprocessing & EDA
Open task_1.ipynb and run all cells.

This task involves handling missing values, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis.

ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Model Training
Open task_2.ipynb and run all cells.

Implements different machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Model Evaluation
Open task_3.ipynb and run all cells.

Compares models using metrics like RMSE, RÂ² Score, and Accuracy.

Results are stored in results.txt.

ðŸ”¹ Task 4: Data Visualization
Open task_4.ipynb and run all cells.

Generates different graphs and plots to understand model performance and dataset insights.

Screenshots of visualizations are saved in the visuals/ folder.

ðŸ“¸ Visualizations

Screenshots of graphs, feature importance plots, and performance comparisons can be found in the visuals/ folder.
